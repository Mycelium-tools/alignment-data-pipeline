"""Seeded pools of fictional people and organisation names for document drafting.

Two failure modes motivate this. First, models asked to "invent" names collapse
to a few favourites ("Dr. Elara Vance", "the Meridian Institute"), which becomes
a corpus-wide fingerprint that pattern detection flags as templating. Second,
letting a generator name real organisations risks pinning invented studies,
quotes, or practices on real actors — misinformation a downstream model could
learn as fact. Handing each drafting call a few names sampled from large,
seeded, multi-locale Faker pools fixes both at once: varied by construction,
fictional by construction.

Pools are reproducible across sessions: Faker is seeded, candidate sets are
sorted before the seeded shuffle (raw set iteration order differs between
processes), and per-document sampling is keyed by the subtype id.
